<h2>Cost vs Total Points</h2>

<p align = "justify">The scatter plot above shows the relationship between the player's price and how many points did they contribute. It seems clear that the more expensive the player, the more points they will generate. This is proven by the 4 most expensive players available which are Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, and Kevin De Bruyne respectively, these 4 players generate the most points. But of course, there are some exceptions too, some players have a considerably high price but did not perform as expected. One of those players is Richarlison (FWD) who was priced at 8.4 but only earned a mere 54 points. And there are also some great budget picks, which means that these players did not have a high price point but generated a considerable amount of points such as: Eberechi Eze (MID, 5.7), Gabriel Martinelli (MID, 6.5), Ivan Toney (FWD, 7.1), Ben White (DEF, 5) </p>
